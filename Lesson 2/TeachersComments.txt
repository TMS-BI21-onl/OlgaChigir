Well done!

It would be more convinient, if you would add homework as .txt or .sql. Thanks!

If we have only one condition it makes more sence to use equals sign: WHERE LastName='Norman'. Your solution works too, it's just not the prettiest.

Here it was asked to COUNT(DISTINCT PersonType). The correct answer should be 6.
Also, you were almost correct with LIKE condition. As you wrote it, it would work as !=1 and we need it to work as NOT LIKE '%1%'.

Color is not required in the SELECT, but it should ne in WHERE. By 'color is defined' I meant 'color is not null'.
